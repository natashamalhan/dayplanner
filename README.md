for this task i created a dayplanner that shows the date at the top and the timings for your day up until 4pm at the bottom, the timings will turn green if in the current time, and red in the past time. i used javascript, html, and css for this project
this will also save your notes in the backend when you type out anything for events and then save, and refresh the page
